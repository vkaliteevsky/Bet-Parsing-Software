::: Change ip using Tor class :::

First add tor.py to your project.

Use case is simple:
from tor import Tor
...

def some_function(...):
	tor = Tor()
	# Open tor connection
	tor.connect()
	...do smth...
	# Change ip address
	tor.reconnect()
	...do smth...
	# Close tor connection
	tor.disconnect() 

P.S. Your should always close tor 
     connection when you've 
     finished your work

With love,
    SM
